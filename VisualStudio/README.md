# Visual Studio Customizations

There is currently just one component which is appearance.

## Appearance

Appearance breaks down into two parts: the editor and the program.

### The Editor

To download:

Either clone the repository and use the vssettings files on your computer, or:

1. On github, find the vssettings file that you want to use, and left click on it to open it.
2. Find the "Raw" button in the top left toolbar.
3. Right-click it and choose "Save link as" and save the file to a known location

To install:

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Tools -> Import and Export Settings...
3. Select "Import selected environment settings"
4. Backup if desired.
5. Click "Browse".
6. Select the vssettings file you downloaded.
7. Click "Next".
8. Done.

### The Program

The IDE itself is easy to customize. Just use the Visual Studio Theme Editor extension appropriate for the version of Visual Studio you're running. Grab the dark solarized theme from [Studio Styles](https://studiostyl.es/) and import it. You should be good to go!
